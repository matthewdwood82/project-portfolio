## DARPA ASIST
### Project Description
The Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST) Program aspired to develop Artificial Intelligence that could learn the shared mental models (SMM) of human teammates, and use theory of mind (ToM) to project the actions of those teammates. AI developers (TA1) produced and trained agents with an ability to learn SMM and apply ToM. Social scientists (TA2) performed research on the mechanisms that AI agents might employ to promote interaction with human teammates, and also developed measures which could be used in production to improve the quality of TA1 agent sensing and interactions. A Test and Evaluation (TA3) team from Aptima, with Arizona State University and the Center for Open Science, developed experiments to test the quality of TA1 agents and the veracity of TA2 theories. 


### Role
I served as lead for implementing evaluation measures and Project Manager for the TA3 team. In the evaluation measure role, I developed a reproducible research pipeline that produced an webpage that TA1 performers could use to see the performance of their agents during TA3 experiments, and provided a model for how TA2 researchers should be developing their analyses in support of their theories. This webpage provided summary tables and visualizations to provide an easy-to-interpret and brief description of both human and AI performance in these studies. As Project Manager, I developed and updated budgets for Aptima and subcontractors in response to changes in program demands and budget in coordination with almost 50 staff members across the three organizations. 


### More Information
A paper with measure summaries and visualizations I developed for the first of three TA3 studies for which I was involved can be found in the conference paper below.

## ARI Skill Retention
### Project Description
Trainer’s Decision Aid is a paper-and-pencil job assessment designed to help military leaders assess individual task demands, work context, and external factors that make skills more difficult to retain in order to identify cognitive interventions (e.g., training, memory aids) to improve retention and enhance performance. Aptima was tasked with calibrating the assessment, and putting it into an electronic format so it is easier for military leaders to use, track results, and perform what-if analysis. The Trainer's Decision Aid - Electronic Scoring Tool (TDA-EST) was developed through a combination of expert elicitation to understand needs of military leaders (specifically combat first aid trainers), empirical collection of training classes to assess retention in the domain, and software engineering and interface design to develop the lightweight TDA-EST.  

### Role
I served as the Principal Investigator and Project Manager for the project. As Principal Investigator, I led the technical vision and execution of the project including expert elicitation, statistical analysis, and software development. As Project Manager, I developed budgets and ensured timely delivery of project reports and other status updates. In both roles, I led a team of four staff and one consultant in technical and programmatic execution. I coordinated data collection with the customer and partners, and pivoted the statistical analysis and software development approach when it was clear that COVID-19 was going to disrupt data collection efforts in a way that would make it difficult to calibrate the software decision tool using data by the end of the period of performance. Instead, we developed an approach where the user or follow-on investigators could update model weights and scoring mechanisms with future expert elicitation or data and easily update the software. 

### More Information

Major deliverables of the project included a decision support software tool written in VBA and Excel, and a User's Guide that walks through the tool and illustrates its major features. The User's Guide is provided below, which includes a walkthrough of the tool as well as a brief description of some of the expert elicitations used to inform its design.

## Houston Ship Channel
### Project Description
The Houston Ship Channel (HSC) is one of the busiest waterway corridors in the United States. Since the channel’s expansion in 2005 and to the time of the project in 2015, concerns were rising about design deficiencies in the HSC in the area of the Bayport Ship Channel (BSC), especially north of the turn at Five Mile Cut. The project conducted a mental models expert elicitation exercise to identify safety concerns arising from these design deficiencies, and provide qualitative information to structure analysis of techical data to better connect possible design deficiencies to incident outcomes. The elicitation produced an influence diagram to enable later causal reasoning for this reach of the HSC and nearby areas, and helped prime a comprehensive study of the feasibility of safety and performance modifications.

### Role
I was responsible for developing and executing the elicitation, and worked with the project lead to synthesize findings and report results.
