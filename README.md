## DARPA ASIST
### Project Description
The Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST) Program aspired to develop Artificial Intelligence that could learn the shared mental models (SMM) of human teammates, and use theory of mind (ToM) to project the actions of those teammates. AI developers (TA1) produced and trained agents with an ability to learn SMM and apply ToM. Social scientists (TA2) performed research on the mechanisms that AI agents might employ to promote interaction with human teammates, and also developed measures which could be used in production to improve the quality of TA1 agent sensing and interactions. A Test and Evaluation (TA3) team from Aptima, with Arizona State University and the Center for Open Science, developed experiments to test the quality of TA1 agents and the veracity of TA2 theories. 


### Role
I served as lead for implementing evaluation measures and Project Manager for the TA3 team. In the evaluation measure role, I developed a reproducible research pipeline that produced an webpage that TA1 performers could use to see the performance of their agents during TA3 experiments, and provided a model for how TA2 researchers should be developing their analyses in support of their theories. This webpage provided summary tables and visualizations to provide an easy-to-interpret and brief description of both human and AI performance in these studies. As Project Manager, I developed and updated budgets for Aptima and subcontractors in response to changes in program demands and budget in coordination with almost 50 staff members across the three organizations. 


### More Information
A paper with measure summaries and visualizations I developed for the first of three TA3 studies for which I was involved can be found in the conference paper below.

## ARI Skill Retention
### Project Description


### Role
I served as the Principal Investigator and Project Manager for the project. As Principal Investigator, I led the technical vision and execution of the project including expert elicitation, statistical analysis, and software development. As Project Manager, I developed budgets and ensured timely delivery of project reports and other status updates. In both roles, I led a team of four staff and one consultant in technical and programmatic execution. I coordinated data collection with the customer and partners, and pivoted the statistical analysis and software development approach when it was clear that COVID-19 was going to disrupt data collection efforts in a way that would make it difficult to calibrate the software decision tool using data by the end of the period of performance. Instead, we developed an approach where the user or follow-on investigators could update model weights and scoring mechanisms with future expert elicitations or data and easily update the software.
